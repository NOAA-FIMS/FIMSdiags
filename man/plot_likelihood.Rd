\title{Plot likelihood profile}
\usage{
plot_likelihood(like_fit, group = "label")
}
\arguments{
\item{like_fit}{List returned by the \code{\link[=fims_likelihood]{fims_likelihood()}} function with
model fits for each step in a likelihood profile}

\item{group}{Character string or vector of strings with columns to group by,
e.g., "label" to group by data type, c("label", "fleet_name") to group by data
type and fleet (although fleet_name is not currently in FIMS output).}
}
\value{
ggplot of likelihood profile
}
\description{
